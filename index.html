      <h3>Lost and Found App</h3>
      <p>"LOFO" is an innovative android application designed to streamline the process of reuniting individuals with their lost 
belongings, addressing a common problem faced in our college community. Lost and found items are managed through a 
manual and time-consuming email system, resulting in a cluttered and inefficient process. Our project aims to simplify this 
ordeal by creating a user-friendly, intuitive app that centralizes the lost and found experience. Users can easily report lost 
items, providing essential details and descriptions, while those who have found items can upload information about the 
discovered belongings. LOFO promotes a more organized and accessible way of managing lost items, reducing the clutter in 
email inboxes, and fostering community by reuniting individuals with their cherished belongings. This project intends to 
enhance the college experience by providing a reliable and user-friendly platform for lost and found items.</p>
